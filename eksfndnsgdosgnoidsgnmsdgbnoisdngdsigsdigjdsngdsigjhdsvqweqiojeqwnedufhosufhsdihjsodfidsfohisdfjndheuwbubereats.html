      <h3>Method #1</h3>
      <h4>The Hair Trick</h4>
      <p>Order your food on UberEats, and put a piece of your hair in the food and go to the "Help" section of UberEats and pick "The Food Quality" option. </p>
      <p>There will be an option to put a picture from your Camera Roll or take one. Press "Take One" and take a picture of your hair in the food. One is recommended.</p>
      <p>Submit it and whalla! In 1-2 hours, you'll get an email saying they are refunding your food!</p>

      <h3>Method #2</h3>
      <h4>Soggy Food Trick</h4>
      <h3>In order for this method to work, there will need to be a "drink" in your order. So if you order from McDonalds, get any fountain drink.</h3>
      <p>Order your tasty food on UberEats and once you get your food, click the "Other Issue" option in the Help Section. Now say something like this for example: </p>
      <q>The lid popped off and when I got the food the drink had spilled and the food was uneatable.</q>
      <p>You are telling them that the burger got soggy because of the drink. (Or any food for that matter.)</p>
      <p>Remember, use your own words and you can add more detail if you want! And whalla! In 1-2 hours, you'll get an email saying they are refunding your food!</p>
      <p></p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Method #3</h3> 
      <h4>Fucking Over The Driver</h4>       
      <p>WARNING: THIS METHOD IS NOT RECOMMENDED WHATSOEVER</p>
      <p>To do this method, order your food on UberEats and after it gets delivered to your house. File a claim that you didn't get it ordered to your house. Within 1-2 hours of your claim, Uber will refund the ENTIRE order.</p>
