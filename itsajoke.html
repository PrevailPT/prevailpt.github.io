  <h1>Here's some news! (And why REXIAWORLD is down right now.)</h1>
  <p>It's Nathan! I'm adding some updates to the website you might love.</p> 
  <p>However, most of the stuff I was planning to do during the Spring Break I never did. Not because I couldn't do them. It was just because I was lazy and forgot about the site.</p>
  <p>So for now, I'm working on it. And I'm gonna need a bit of time.</p>
  <p>So, the website is going offline for a bit. </p>
  
  <p>If you have a private ticket for Beta access of the website, <a href="ticket_entry.html">visit here</a>.</p>

  <h3>DISCLAIMER: None of the accounts on the website have been updated since March 7th. So, trust me. If some, don't work. Don't blame me. They aren't meant to be used at the moment.</h3>

  <p>Also. Please stop asking me for personal Spotify Premium accounts till I'm done with the updates. Thanks. </p>
