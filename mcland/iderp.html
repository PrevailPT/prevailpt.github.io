  <h1>iDerp where's my money?</h1>
  <p>so, if your confused why this is the title of rexiaworld here's why</p> 
  <p>a week ago, our friend discoli told us about this amazon method and iderp immediately jumps ship on it. but the problem is, he stole the card i was allowed to use</p>
  <p> so he promised to give me one back, and he sorta did? but his amazon account got banned </p>
  <p> AND NOW HE'S DOING IT AGAIN AND IT WORKS, SO WHERE'S MY MONEY? </p>
  
  <p> spread this everywhere "iderp where's rexia's money" </p>
