  <h2>Why <img src="img/rexia_main_version_transparent.png"> doesn't have Netflix accounts. <strong>Still.</strong></h2>
  <center><h3>It's been 4 months.</h3></center>
</div>
<center><p>Netflix accounts have never been a big part of the website. And I don't think they have ever been. When it first came to the site there was only 4 and they worked. Now, no one cares about them except for the 4 people who use this site and used them. (Temporarily.)</p>

<p>However, because I'm commited to my promises for the site. I've decided to release a statement on why <kbd>Netflix</kbd> isn't on the website, and won't be for a while.</p>

<p>For the past couple of weeks, I've had much success with adding other legacy accounts back to the website. <kbd>Fortnite</kbd>, <kbd>Spotify</kbd>, <kbd>PH Premium</kbd>, and much more that I'll be adding soon. However, I've suffered the most difficulty with Netflix.</p>

<p>I just want to make this clear that <strong>this isn't the end of hope for Netflix</strong> but it's no doubt become increasingly difficult to get Netflix accounts to work.</p></center>

<div class="container">
<p>Rather than just tell you that, I'll explain why.</p>
<br>
<p class="bg-primary">Over the course of 4 months, Netflix has added more protection over cracking their accounts.</p>
<p>REXIAWORLD operates on cracking accounts for many users. Because of this, getting one account and checking it one at a time is insufficient. So, all accounts that are in an environment are checked.</p>

<p class="bg-primary">To explain this easier, rather than checking one account for Spotify. 1000 accounts are checked.</p>
<p>And Netflix has made it harder for people to check accounts constantly. You see, getting the accounts are easy. Very easy. But it's checking them to make sure they work.
</p>
<p><kbd>Netflix</kbd> as a company restricts that. So you'd need some high quality Proxies to begin checking them. And at this time, I can't provide that.</p>

<p>This is why <strong>Netflix accounts</strong> will be unavailable for a bit.</p>
