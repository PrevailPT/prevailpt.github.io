<h3> February 21, 2019 </h3>
<p> Welcome back to REXIAWORLD folks. Not much to talk about here since the site wasn't updated. But I've started to see through a password system for the website. </p>

  <h3>February 11, 2019</h3>
  <p>REXIAWORLD was shut down last year for some private reasons,but since those were resolved it is back up and better then ever.
  </p>
  <p>The site had to be re-designed, and now accounts are no longer on a seperate page. They are now on the same page as the tab of their name.</p>
